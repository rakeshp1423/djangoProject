## key Features

### User Authentication:
 The application likely includes user authentication functionality, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.
### Database Integration: 
It likely integrates with a database to store and manage data. The models.py file suggests that you define database models to represent your application's data structure.
### Views and URL Routing:
 The views.py file contains views, which handle HTTP requests and return HTTP responses. URL routing, defined in the urls.py file, directs requests to the appropriate views.
### Static Files Handling: 
The project handles static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images to ensure a visually appealing and interactive user interface.
### Templates: 
HTML templates are likely used to render dynamic content and provide a structured layout for the web pages.
### Admin Panel: 
Django's built-in admin interface may be included to allow administrators to manage site content and user accounts easily.
### Deployment: 
The project may include configurations for deployment to a web server, although this isn't evident from the repository.
